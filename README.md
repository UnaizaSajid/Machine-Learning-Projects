# Machine-Learning-Projects

Machine Learning is a sub-field that comes under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence. It is concerned with making machines capable enough to act and make decisions,
without being explicitly programmed. The machine adjusts its performance and accuracy according to the information it is being exposed to.  
ML provides machines the ability to automatically learn and upgrade themselves with the help of provided data and its experience. 
The learning is achieved by a parametric model that takes some parameters or hyper-parameters and is capable to tune (manually or automatically) to achieve better 
performance. In recent years, we are surrounded by numerous applications of Machine Learning such as Anomaly Detection, Virtual Personal Assistants, Speech Recognition, 
Image/Face Recognition, Videos Surveillance, Email Spam and Malware Filtering, Recommendation Systems, Effective Web Search, and a Better understanding
of the human genome, etc. 

There are some well-known publically available datasets that are being widely used in ML projects. Few of them are implemented with state-of-the-art ML algorithms, 
including KNN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.
